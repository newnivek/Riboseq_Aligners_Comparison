# Riboseq_Aligners_Comparison
Comparing aligners for ribo-seq reads
Objective: Evaluate the performance of a read aligner tool. Specifically, determine how well the tool can correctly align artificial reads back to their original locations in a reference genome.
1. Generate artificial reads: Utilize the ART tool to generate artificial reads from a reference genome. This simulates sequencing data. As these reads are artificially created, their true locations in the reference genome are known.
2. Align the artificial reads: Use a chosen read aligner tool to align these artificial reads back to the reference genome. This creates a BAM file containing the alignment information.
3. Create a BED file for the true locations: From the information generated by the ART tool, a BED file is created that lists the true locations of the artificial reads in the reference genome.
4. Intersect the alignments with the true locations: Compare the alignment locations from the BAM file with the true locations from the BED file using BEDTools intersect. This results in an intersected BED file, which contains the reads that were correctly mapped back to their original locations.
5. Analyze the alignment performance: Calculate various metrics to evaluate the performance of the read aligner using both the intersected BED file and the original BAM file. These metrics include the total number of reads, the number of correctly and incorrectly mapped reads, precision (the proportion of mapped reads that are placed correctly), and recall (the proportion of reads that align with mapQ value over the specified threshold).
This process assesses the accuracy of the read aligner tool, which is vital for downstream bioinformatics analyses.
